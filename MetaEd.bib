abstract = {The metaverse has been recognized as one of the technologies with the greatest potential today. However, the use of the metaverse for educational purposes is seldom discussed. Most educators might be unaware of the features of the metaverse, not to mention the potential applications of this emerging technology. In this position paper, we aim to provide a clear definition of the metaverse. Potential applications and research issues of the metaverse in educational settings are also presented. Moreover, the roles of AI in the metaverse as well as metaverse-based education are discussed. It is expected that, via this paper, researchers from the fields of both computer science and educational technology would have a clear picture of what the metaverse is and how it can be used for educational purposes. More importantly, it is expected that more studies related to metaverse-based education can be reported in the near future.}

abstract = {This review aims to define the 4 types of the metaverse and to explain the 
      potential and limitations of its educational applications. The metaverse roadmap 
      categorizes the metaverse into 4 types: augmented reality, lifelogging, mirror 
      world, and virtual reality. An example of the application of augmented reality in 
      medical education would be an augmented reality T-shirt that allows students to 
      examine the inside of the human body as an anatomy lab. Furthermore, a research 
      team in a hospital in Seoul developed a spinal surgery platform that applied 
      augmented reality technology. The potential of the metaverse as a new educational 
      environment is suggested to be as follows: a space for new social communication; 
      a higher degree of freedom to create and share; and the provision of new 
      experiences and high immersion through virtualization. Some of its limitations 
      may be weaker social connections and the possibility of privacy impingement; the 
      commission of various crimes due to the virtual space and anonymity of the 
      metaverse; and maladaptation to the real world for students whose identity has 
      not been established. The metaverse is predicted to change our daily life and 
      economy beyond the realm of games and entertainment. The metaverse has infinite 
      potential as a new social communication space. The following future tasks are 
      suggested for the educational use of the metaverse: first, teachers should 
      carefully analyze how students understand the metaverse; second, teachers should 
      design classes for students to solve problems or perform projects cooperatively 
      and creatively; third, educational metaverse platforms should be developed that 
      prevent misuse of student data.}

ABSTRACT = {The Metaverse is the post-reality universe, a perpetual and persistent multiuser environment merging physical reality with digital virtuality. It is based on the convergence of technologies that enable multisensory interactions with virtual environments, digital objects and people such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Hence, the Metaverse is an interconnected web of social, networked immersive environments in persistent multiuser platforms. It enables seamless embodied user communication in real-time and dynamic interactions with digital artifacts. Its first iteration was a web of virtual worlds where avatars were able to teleport among them. The contemporary iteration of the Metaverse features social, immersive VR platforms compatible with massive multiplayer online video games, open game worlds and AR collaborative spaces.},

abstract={The Metaverse has been the centre of attraction for educationists for quite some time. This field got renewed interest with the announcement of social media giant Facebook as it rebranding and positioning it as Meta. While several studies conducted literature reviews to summarize the findings related to the Metaverse in general, no study to the best of our knowledge focused on systematically summarizing the finding related to the Metaverse in education. To cover this gap, this study conducts a systematic literature review of the Metaverse in education. It then applies both content and bibliometric analysis to reveal the research trends, focus, and limitations of this research topic. The obtained findings reveal the research gap in lifelogging applications in educational Metaverse. The findings also show that the design of Metaverse in education has evolved over generations, where generation Z is more targeted with artificial intelligence technologies compared to generation X or Y. In terms of learning scenarios, there have been very few studies focusing on mobile learning, hybrid learning, and micro learning. Additionally, no study focused on using the Metaverse in education for students with disabilities. The findings of this study provide a roadmap of future research directions to be takenÂ into consideration and investigated to enhance the adoption of the Metaverse in education worldwide, as well as to enhance the learning and teaching experiences in the Metaverse.},
